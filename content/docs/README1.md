# Endeavour OS Basics

This user guide overviews maintenance tasks for systems running __Endeavour OS__, relevant terminal commands, general user tools, and links to additional resources.

## Overview

__[Endeavour OS][eos]__ is a resource-light and terminal-centric distro based on [Arch Linux][arch]. Along with the classic Arch installation experience for power users, it also provides an easy installation and setup process via the Calamares tool.

Linux systems are highly customizeable but require more hands-on maintenance to run smoothly. Users should regularly:

 1. __Back up__ system files
 2. __Update__ important programs
 3. __Clean__ out unused files

Through terminal commands, users can upgrade essential packages, obtain new program features, and ensure system stability and security.

> __NOTE__
>
> This repository is a reference for my personal setup and experience with Endeavour OS. In addition to basic wiki guides and a maintenance cheatsheet, this repo includes custom scripts that can be used as general tools and program shortcuts.
